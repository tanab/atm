PRIORITY ONE
- Refactor data cache structures to minimize it's number and simplify the code.

PRIORITY TWO
- Place dbitvec definition to appropriate place to be available across the project.
- If reverse iterating is not necessary for result children of a node it might be better to use std::forward_list
- Maybe result children and letter children should be kept by it's own pointers to avoid cast.
- Some cache structures depend on id being continuous and to start with 1.
